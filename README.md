# Stock Discovery

Private Indian equity research: discover stocks using news, fundamentals, technical indicators, candles and volume; produce evidence-linked recommendations; compare forecasts and simulated trades with subsequent prices and forward paper results.

Agreed architecture: React + TypeScript + Lightweight Charts, FastAPI, one scheduled Python worker, PostgreSQL, shared Python analysis for historical and live modes, and Docker Compose. An existing LLM supports grounded research; predictive ML experiments come later. No initial microservices, Kubernetes or Redis.

Current ticket: **STK-010 — Repository and application setup**, P1, v0.1. **Review/Test**: a local React/TypeScript shell, FastAPI API, scheduled Python worker, shared analysis package, migration scaffold, PostgreSQL service and Docker Compose have been added with synthetic data only. STK-011 navigation and all later application features remain unstarted.
